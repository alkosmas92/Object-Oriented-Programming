Compile : 1) c++ forum.cpp -o forum
Run : 2) ./forum

I Implement the C ++ the image of a discussion forum, e.g. “Object Oriented Program-as described below. A forum it consisted of its "title" and a number of threads. Each thread consists of a "theme", its "creator", the "creation date" and a host of posts. Each post consists of a "numeric identifier" (id, unique for each post), the Its "title", its "creator", its "creation date" and a text. When creating a post, the values of the data are assigned and printed on the screen. When destroyed, the message "Post number: ⟨Post_number⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where⟨Post_number⟩is the numerical reference feature of the post. When creating a thread, its subject, creator and date are assigned of its creation. Also it is printed on the screen the message "Thread with subject:" ⟨Subject⟩ has just been created! ", where the ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread. When a threadis destructioned, the message is printed on the screen, "Thread with subject: ⟨Subject⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread. When creating a forum, its title is assigned and the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ has just been created! ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the title of the forum. When destroyed, is displayed on the screen the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the topic of the forum. Regarding the behavior of the above, the following applies. For the forum to given the ability to be printed, by printing the titles of its threads. Also given the ability to select a thread by specifying the title and then print the thread. Finally, for the forum to be given the opportunity to select a post, giving it number and then this post to be printed. A thread is printed by printing its subject, its creator, the date of publication, his creator and his posts. A post is printed, printing its number, its title, its creator, the date of its creation and its text. I increase the behavior of the above forum with another function print-sorted which prints all his posts sorted in ascending order per creator. The posts of the same author, among themselves, let them not be sorted by somehow. I use a binary search tree structure for ranking tree, with nodes consisting of the creators accompanied by a list with their posts. I create this structure, for each post, if there is no node set to correspond to its creator, to insert a new node in the appropriate position. If already exists, just i add the post to the list. The tree should be initialized by taking a thread as a given, entering all its posts. Once it has been created, there is a possibility to insert a new post in the tree as described above.
Also, to be able to print the tree, printing their contents nodes, as the type of their part of indicates. Print in order visit the nodes "first in depth and from left to right" inorder traversal. Finally, offer the possibility of increasing the tree with the contents of another tree. For each node of the second tree, if for its creator there is a node in first tree, its posts should be added to the list of posts of the first. Otherwise, yes a new node is created in the first tree containing the node contents.

Example with :

I create a forum entitled "Object Oriented Programming"
I print the forum
I print the thread on "Rules and useful information"
I select (randomly) some posts, and print them.
Αssumptions :

I create tables with which I will enter random elements in the classes (Post, Thread, Forum).

Post: random values ​​from some tables for subject, creator, today, text and increase id each time.

Thread: random values ​​from some tables for title, creator, today and creating a static table from post with index to table Post * post[] to insert the posts.

List_node: consisting of Post * data, List_node * next

List: consisting of List_node * head, * length with basic functions:

add (Post * value): introduction print_list (): print print_list (): copy

Tree_node: consisting of List list_post, Tree_node * right, * left. Tree: consisting of Tree_node * root and constructor to create the original tree with a basic function

Tree_enhance: make a copy of each post that must be entered to extend the tree

Forum: Value of forum_subject from the argument, and create a static table with a pointer to a table Thread * thread [] to insert the threads. With recommendations: print_threads: prints all threads. find_the_thread: prints all posts of a specific one thread. find_the_post: prints all the posts we select. print_sorted (): implement and print the tree using Tree ** end_tree
