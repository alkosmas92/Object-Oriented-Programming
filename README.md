 I Implement the C ++ the image of a discussion forum, e.g. “Object Oriented Program-as described below. 
 A forum it consisted of its "title" and a number of threads.
Each thread consists of a "theme", its "creator", the "creation date" and a host of posts. Each post consists of a "numeric identifier" (id, unique for each post), the Its "title", its "creator", its "creation date" and a text. 
   When creating a post, the values of the data are assigned and printed on the screen. When destroyed, the message "Post number: ⟨Post_number⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where⟨Post_number⟩is the numerical reference feature of the post. 
  When creating a thread, its subject, creator and date are assigned of its creation. Also it is printed on the screen the message "Thread with subject:" ⟨Subject⟩ has just been created! ", where the ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread. When a threadis destructioned,  the message is printed on the screen, "Thread with subject: ⟨Subject⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread.
When creating a forum, its title is assigned and the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ has just been created! ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the title of the forum. When destroyed, is displayed on the screen the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the topic of the forum.
 Regarding the behavior of the above, the following applies. For the forum to given the ability to be printed, by printing the titles of its threads. Also given the ability to select a thread by specifying the title and then print the thread. Finally, for the forum to be given the opportunity to select a post, giving it number and then this post to be printed.
 A thread is printed by printing its subject, its creator, the date of publication, his creator and his posts.
 A post is printed, printing its number, its title, its creator, the date of its creation and its text.
Example with :
1. I create a forum entitled "Object Oriented Programming"
2. I print the forum
3. I print the thread on "Rules and useful information"
4. I select (randomly) some posts, and print them.
