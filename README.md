# Simple object-oriented programming project-with-C++ 

Compile : 1) g++ forum.cpp -o forum  
Run :     2) ./forum

 I Implement the C ++ the image of a discussion forum, e.g. “Object Oriented Program-as described below. 
 A forum it consisted of its "title" and a number of threads.
Each thread consists of a "theme", its "creator", the "creation date" and a host of posts. Each post consists of a "numeric identifier" (id, unique for each post), the Its "title", its "creator", its "creation date" and a text. 
   When creating a post, the values of the data are assigned and printed on the screen. When destroyed, the message "Post number: ⟨Post_number⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where⟨Post_number⟩is the numerical reference feature of the post. 
  When creating a thread, its subject, creator and date are assigned of its creation. Also it is printed on the screen the message "Thread with subject:" ⟨Subject⟩ has just been created! ", where the ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread. When a threadis destructioned,  the message is printed on the screen, "Thread with subject: ⟨Subject⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Subject⟩ is the subject of the thread.
When creating a forum, its title is assigned and the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ has just been created! ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the title of the forum. When destroyed, is displayed on the screen the message "Forum with title: ⟨Title⟩ is about to be destroyed ", where ⟨Title⟩ is the topic of the forum.
 Regarding the behavior of the above, the following applies. For the forum to given the ability to be printed, by printing the titles of its threads. Also given the ability to select a thread by specifying the title and then print the thread. Finally, for the forum to be given the opportunity to select a post, giving it number and then this post to be printed.
 A thread is printed by printing its subject, its creator, the date of publication, his creator and his posts.
 A post is printed, printing its number, its title, its creator, the date of its creation and its text.
    I increase the behavior of the above forum with another function print-sorted which prints all his posts sorted in ascending order per creator. The posts of the same author, among themselves, let them not be sorted by somehow. 
    I use a binary search tree structure for ranking tree, with nodes consisting of the creators accompanied by a list with their posts. I create this structure, for each post, if there is no node set to correspond to its creator, to insert a new node in the appropriate position. If already exists, just i add the post to the list. The tree should be initialized by taking a thread as a given, entering all its posts. Once it has been created, there is a possibility to insert a new post in the tree as described above.     
   Also, to be able to print the tree, printing their contents nodes, as the type of their part of indicates. Print in order visit the nodes "first in depth and from left to right" inorder traversal.
 Finally, offer the possibility of increasing the tree with the contents of another tree. 
 For each node of the second tree, if for its creator there is a node in first tree, its posts should be added to the list of posts of the first. Otherwise, yes a new node is created in the first tree containing the node contents.
 
Example with :
1. I create a forum entitled "Object Oriented Programming"
2. I print the forum
3. I print the thread on "Rules and useful information"
4. I select (randomly) some posts, and print them.

Αssumptions :

I create tables with which I will enter random elements in the classes (Post, Thread, Forum).

Post: random values ​​from some tables for subject, creator, today, text and increase id each time.

Thread: random values ​​from some tables for title, creator, today and creating a static table from post with index to table Post * post[] to insert  the posts.

List_node: consisting of Post * data, List_node * next

List: consisting of List_node * head, * length with basic functions:

add (Post * value): introduction
print_list (): print
print_list (): copy

Tree_node: consisting of List list_post, Tree_node * right, * left.
Tree: consisting of Tree_node * root and constructor to create the original tree with a basic function

Tree_enhance: make a copy of each post that must be entered to extend the tree

Forum: Value of forum_subject from the argument, and create a static table with a pointer to a table Thread * thread [] to insert the threads. With recommendations:
print_threads: prints all threads.
find_the_thread: prints all posts of a specific one thread.
find_the_post: prints all the posts we select.
print_sorted (): implement and print the tree using Tree ** end_tree

-I declare in the class String and class PlaneComponent before the pre-definition because of i use them before their initialization

-namespace patch i am definited them because i need it for the to_string function

-Abstract classes οι Object, Employee, PlaneComponent

-class Object: set the protected to object_id to which is defined outside the class, increments each time for
uniqueness, in addition I create some basic functions with virtual Object * clone () = 0 and String toString () = 0

-class String: inherited from Object with protected name and i create basic functions using ready-made library functions

- class employee: public object with protected string * name_employee and virtual workon vision (PlaneComponent *
pas_com) = 0 and reference (PlaneComponent * pas_com) = 0

- class PlaneComponent : public Object με protected: bool check_clean , bool check_security , bool
check_maintenance οι οποιες μεταβλητές θα αρχικοποιηθούν 0 ως ένδιξη οτι δεν εχουν υλοποιηθεί οι αντιστοιχες
εργασίες που τους αναλογούν,ορίζονται και αντιστοιχες συναρτησείς που βοηθούν την διαχείρηση τους και με το
όρισμα ως virtual την bool ready_check()=0 , virtual void process(Employee* empl)=0

-class SecurityEmployee:public Employee σημαντικο σημειο της κλασής η χρήση των workon και report συναρτήσεων
οι οποίες συνδένται με την PlaneComponent και υλοποιυν τον έλενχο αν έγινε η εργασια και αλλάζουν την
check_security σε 1 ετσι ωστε μας δηλώνει οτι πέρασε η εργασια εκτελέστηκε αλλα και με το report το οποιο
εκτυπώνει και το αντίστοιχο ΟΚ.

- class MaintenanceEmployee:public Employee και class CleaningEmployee:public Employee αντίστοιχες με class
SecurityEmployee:public Employee.

-class Passengercompartment:public PlaneComponent με private Passengercompartment* pas_com = NULL για ελενχο
αν υπαχρει περαιτέρο Passengercompartment και αντιστοιχει constractor για να ικανοποιεί ολες τις συνθήκες με
αντίστοιχη προυπόθεση και στην process η οποία μας οδηγεί το εργαζόμενο να κάνει την εργασία του και να ελένχεται
στην ready_check αν έγιναν ολες οι απαραίτητες του τομέα,και στην equal να γίνονται μια σειρά απο ελένχους.

-PrivateCompartment : public PlaneComponent απλα εναν constractor και εναν distractor

-class EquipmentCompartment : public PrivateCompartment παρόμοιες λειτουργίς με την Passengercompartment με
διαφορα στους την αφαίρεση των ελένχων για τον επιπλέον χώρο

- CargoBay : public PrivateCompartment αντιστοιχες λειτουργιες με SecurityEmployee αλλά χωρίς αμφιβολία για
επιπλέον χώρο εξοπλισμού.

-class Plane : public Object τελική κλάση με private:
String *title;
int space_passenger
CargoBay * cargo_bay
EquipmentCompartment* pas_one
EquipmentCompartment* pas_two
EquipmentCompartment* pas_three
vector<Passengercompartment*> Passenger_compartment
με αντιστοιχες αρχικοποιησεις στον constractor με τις βασικες συναρτήσεις να διατηρουν την προηγουμενη τους
λογίκη αλλά σε μεγαλύτερη εκταση των ελένχων και με τον vector<Passengercompartment*> Passenger_compartment
να προσθέτει καποια στιχεία.

-clone_encrypt_and_print απλη χρήση των συναρτήσεων
